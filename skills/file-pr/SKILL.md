# File PR

Before filing, check whether a PR for this branch already exists. Review the diff locally against `origin/main` to make sure its contents match the goal.

PR titles usually become commit messages, so follow the repository's title conventions. Look at recently merged PRs and Git history for examples. Prefer a concise, human-readable title that explains why the change matters:

BAD
> ❌ perf(server): negotiate permessage-deflate on the websocket

GOOD
> ✅ perf(server): cut websocket frame size by 70%+ with gzipping

Open the description with a simple explanation of the problem based on the user's original prompt, then briefly explain the solution. Do not lead with an implementation inventory:

BAD
> ❌ Removed implicit workspace carry-over from every "new thread" entry point (cmd+n / cmd+shift+o, sidebar v1/v2 buttons, command palette). New threads inherit only the project from context; branch, worktree, and env mode always come from the configured defaults. Deleted buildContextualThreadOptions startNewThreadInProjectFromContext

GOOD
> ✅ My new worktree default was ignored when starting new threads on existing worktrees — super unintuitive. Now your preference is always applied.

Open a real PR, not a draft. Drafts do not get review-bot coverage.

If the user also asked to babysit, continue with the `babysit-pr` skill.
